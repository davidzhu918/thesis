As the scale of enterprise web applications grows rapidly, finding an effective way for testing site reliability is becoming increasingly important. As a widely-used testing technique, penetration testing is able to exploit the vulnerabilities of a web application by simulating all possible request sendings from the client. Traditionally, penetration testers write web crawler programs to extract interface information from frontend HTML webpages, and manually generate test requests to send to the server. Such process has two major draw-backs. First, a web application may not expose all of its interface

To address this issue, we present a novel approach which uses program static analysis is exploited. This new penetration testing system is not only able to estimate user inputs more precisely, but also able to determine interfaces exposed by applications. This research applicable for PHP web applications.

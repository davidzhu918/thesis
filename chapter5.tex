\chapter{Conclusion}
In this paper we presented a novel approach for performing automated penetration testing for PHP web applications. It uses static analysis to identify the application program's behavior on each variable and function, and then construct the possible interfaces exposed by the application as well as the possible values that each request field can take. We compared the effectiveness of this new test system with traditional penetration testing tools, in terms of interface discovery and test case generation. The result shows our proposed testing tool can not only identify more interfaces for dynamic web applications, but is able to achieve higher code coverage by using fewer test cases.
